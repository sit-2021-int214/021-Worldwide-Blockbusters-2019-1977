## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `str_subset` from package ([stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)). extracts the matching components.
```
str_subset(prog_book$Book_title,"Programming")
```
- Function `str_detect` from package ([stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)). tells you if there’s any match to the pattern.
```
sum(str_detect(prog_book$Type, "^Hardcover"))
```
- Function `str_count` from package ([stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)). counts the number of patterns.
```
str_count(prog_book$Type, "[aeiou]")
```
- Function `str_lacate` from package ([stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)). gives the position of the match.
```
str_locate(prog_book$Type, "[aeiou]")
```
- Function `str_extract` from package ([stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)). extracts the text of the match.
```
str_extract(prog_book$Type, "[aeiou]")
```
- Function `str_match` from package ([stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)). extracts parts of the match defined by parentheses.
```
str_match(prog_book$Type, "(.)[aeiou](.)")
```
- Function `str_replace` from package ([stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)). replaces the matches with new text.
```
str_replace(prog_book$Type, "[aeiou]", "??")
```
- Function `str_split` from package ([stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)). splits up a string into multiple pieces.
```
str_split(prog_book$Book_title, "-")
```
## Part 3: Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

#### 1.) How the most have type of book?
#### Code:
```
prog_book %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  count(Type)
```

#### Result:

```
  Type                      n
  <chr>                 <int>
1 Boxed Set - Hardcover     1
2 ebook                     7
3 Hardcover                95
4 Kindle Edition           10
5 Paperback               156
6 Unknown Binding           2
```
#### Explain
- The modt type of Book is PaperBack.
- PaperBak there is a total of 156 book. 
#### 2.) List of the cheapest books.
#### Code:
```
prog_book %>% 
  filter(Price == min(Price))%>%
  select(Book_title,Price) 
```

#### Result:

```
             Book_title         Price
1 The Elements of Style      9.323529
```
#### Explain
- The cheapest book is The Elements of Style.
- The Elements of Style there is a price of 9.323529$.
#### 3.) The Books that are not review at all
#### Code:
```
notReviewed <- prog_book %>% select(Book_title, Reviews)
notReviewed <- notReviewed %>% filter(Reviews == 0)
```

#### Result:

```
